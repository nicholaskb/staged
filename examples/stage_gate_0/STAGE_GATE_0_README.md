| File | Purpose | Format |
|------|---------|--------|
| `stage_gate_0_example.py` | Main generator script | Python |
| `stage_gate_0_example.ttl` | RDF semantic representation | Turtle/TTL |
| `stage_gate_0_summary.json` | Structured data for integration | JSON |
| `stage_gate_0_queries.sparql` | Validation & analysis queries | SPARQL |
| `test_stage_gate_0.py` | Validation & workflow simulation | Python |
| `visualize_stage_gate.py` | ASCII visualizations | Python |

## Quick Start

### 1. Generate Stage Gate Data
```bash
python stage_gate_0_example.py
```
Creates RDF, JSON, and SPARQL files from source CSV data.

### 2. Validate & Test
```bash
python test_stage_gate_0.py
```
Validates TTL structure and simulates complete workflow.

### 3. Visualize
```bash
python visualize_stage_gate.py
```
Shows ASCII diagrams, timelines, and decision trees.

## Stage Gate 0 Summary

- **Value Stream**: CGT (Cell & Gene Therapy)
- **Gate Number**: 0
- **Description**: Entry in Early Development
- **Total Deliverables**: 17
- **Functional Areas**: 5

### Deliverables by Area:
- Analytical Development (AD): 4
- API (Cell & Gene): 3
- CMC Leadership (CMC-L): 7
- Discovery: 2
- Material Sciences (MS): 1

## Workflow Phases

1. **Week 1**: Assignment (all 17 deliverables assigned)
2. **Week 2-3**: Execution (70% started)
3. **Week 4-6**: Completion (100% complete)
4. **Gate Review**: Pass/Fail decision

## Key Features

✅ **Complete Implementation**: From data extraction to workflow simulation
✅ **Standard Formats**: RDF/TTL for semantics, JSON for integration
✅ **Validation**: Built-in TTL validation and SPARQL queries
✅ **Workflow Simulation**: Team assignment and progress tracking
✅ **Visual Representation**: ASCII diagrams and decision trees
✅ **Scalable Design**: Pattern applies to all 13 stage gates

## Integration Options

### Triple Store
```sparql
# Load stage_gate_0_example.ttl into GraphDB/Fuseki
# Run queries from stage_gate_0_queries.sparql
```

### Project Management
```python
# Use stage_gate_0_summary.json
import json
with open('stage_gate_0_summary.json') as f:
    data = json.load(f)
# Export to Jira, MS Project, etc.
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test with real triple store** (GraphDB, Fuseki)
2. **Create dashboard** for visualization
3. **Scale to other gates** (1-12)
4. **Add dependency management** between deliverables
5. **Implement notifications** for status changes

## Why Stage Gate 0?

Stage Gate 0 was chosen for this v0 implementation because:
- **Simplest structure**: Only 17 deliverables
- **Clear boundaries**: Entry point to development
- **Complete example**: Shows all functional areas
- **Low complexity**: Ideal for proof of concept
- **Foundation**: Pattern scales to more complex gates

## Success Criteria

✅ All 17 deliverables tracked
✅ RDF representation validates
✅ SPARQL queries execute
✅ Workflow completes 100%
✅ Gate passage decision made
