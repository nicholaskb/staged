# Stage Gate 0 Example: Complete Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document demonstrates a complete v0 implementation of a stage gate process using **CGT Stage Gate 0 (Entry in Early Development)** as the simplest example. Stage Gate 0 has only 17 deliverables across 5 functional areas, making it ideal for a proof of concept.

## What is a Stage Gate Process?

A stage gate process is a project management technique that divides product development into distinct stages separated by decision points (gates). At each gate, deliverables must be completed before proceeding to the next stage.

```
[Discovery] --> Gate 0 --> [Early Dev] --> Gate 1 --> [Phase 1] --> Gate 2 --> [Phase 2] ...
```

## Implementation Components

### 1. Data Model

The stage gate data model consists of:

- **Stage Gate**: The checkpoint (e.g., Gate 0: Entry in ED)
- **Functional Areas**: Teams responsible for deliverables (e.g., Analytical Development, API, CMC Leadership)
- **Deliverables**: Specific tasks or documents required to pass the gate
- **Metadata**: Owner assignments, status tracking, VPAD-specific flags

### 2. File Outputs

The implementation generates four key files:

#### a) `stage_gate_0_example.ttl` - RDF/Semantic Web Format
```turtle
sg:CGT-Gate-0 a sg:StageGate ;
    rdfs:label "CGT Stage Gate 0: Entry in ED" ;
    sg:valueStream "CGT" ;
    sg:gateNumber 0 .

sg:Deliverable-CGT-0-AD-1 a sg:Deliverable ;
    rdfs:label "Start collaboration with Cell Engineering..." ;
    sg:functionalArea sg:Area-Analytical_Development_AD ;
    sg:stageGate sg:CGT-Gate-0 .
```

#### b) `stage_gate_0_summary.json` - Structured Data
```json
{
  "stage_gate": {
    "id": "CGT-0",
    "value_stream": "CGT",
    "gate_number": 0,
    "description": "Entry in ED (C&GT)",
    "deliverable_count": 17
  },
  "functional_areas": {
    "Analytical Development (AD)": {
      "deliverable_count": 4,
      "deliverables": [...]
    }
  }
}
```

#### c) `stage_gate_0_queries.sparql` - Validation Queries
- Count total deliverables
- List deliverables by functional area
- Find unassigned deliverables
- Generate gate summary

#### d) Test & Workflow Simulation
- Validates TTL structure
- Simulates team assignment
- Tracks progress through gate
- Assesses gate readiness

## Stage Gate 0 Structure

### Functional Areas and Deliverables

| Functional Area | Count | Key Deliverables |
|-----------------|-------|------------------|
| **Analytical Development (AD)** | 4 | - Start collaboration with Cell Engineering<br>- Review available data from TD<br>- Identify critical reagents<br>- Identify de novo methods |
| **API (Cell & Gene)** | 3 | - Review plasmid construct details<br>- Full plasmid sequencing<br>- Sourcing committee review |
| **CMC Leadership (CMC-L)** | 7 | - EHS requirements<br>- Risk assessment<br>- Team assignments<br>- Target molecule profile<br>- Critical questions<br>- Material sourcing strategy<br>- Donor material alignment |
| **Discovery** | 2 | - Knowledge transfer from IPSC<br>- IPSC meetings completed |
| **Material Sciences (MS)** | 1 | - Material and supplier selection |

## Workflow Process

### Phase 1: Initialization (Week 1)
```
1. Extract deliverables from source data
2. Generate RDF representation
3. Create JSON summary for reporting
4. Initialize workflow tracking
```

### Phase 2: Assignment (Week 1)
```
Team Members:
- Alice Johnson (AD Lead)
- Bob Smith (API Specialist)
- Carol Davis (CMC Manager)
- David Wilson (Discovery)
- Eve Martinez (Materials)

Each deliverable assigned to appropriate team member
```

### Phase 3: Execution (Weeks 2-3)
```
- 70% of deliverables started
- Regular progress tracking
- Mid-point assessment
```

### Phase 4: Completion (Weeks 4-6)
```
- Complete in-progress items
- Fast-track remaining deliverables
- Final validation
```

### Phase 5: Gate Assessment
```
Gate Readiness Criteria:
✓ All 17 deliverables completed (100%)
✓ All functional areas at 100%
✓ Documentation complete
✓ Reviews conducted

Result: READY TO PASS STAGE GATE 0
```

## Running the Example

### 1. Generate Stage Gate Data
```bash
python stage_gate_0_example.py
```

Output:
- Creates TTL, JSON, and SPARQL files
- Shows deliverable counts by area
- Provides next steps

### 2. Validate and Test
```bash
python test_stage_gate_0.py
```

Features:
- TTL structure validation
- SPARQL query simulation
- Workflow progression simulation
- Gate readiness assessment

## Integration Points

### 1. Triple Store Integration
Load the TTL file into:
- GraphDB
- Apache Fuseki
- Amazon Neptune
- Stardog

### 2. Query Execution
Run SPARQL queries to:
- Monitor progress
- Generate reports
- Find bottlenecks
- Track dependencies

### 3. Project Management Tools
Export JSON data to:
- Jira (via REST API)
- Microsoft Project
- Smartsheet
- Custom dashboards

## Scaling to Other Stage Gates

This example can be extended to other stage gates:

| Stage | Gate Name | Deliverables | Complexity |
|-------|-----------|--------------|------------|
| 0 | Entry in ED | 17 | Low |
| 1 | NME Selection | 71 | Medium |
| 2 | Ph1/2 Readiness | 88 | Medium |
| 3 | Ph2b/3 Assessment | 64 | Medium |
| 4 | Ph2b/3 Readiness | 72 | High |
| 5 | Registration Readiness | 96 | High |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
| 12 | Post-Launch | 58 | Medium |

## Key Benefits

1. **Semantic Structure**: RDF format enables reasoning and inference
2. **Queryability**: SPARQL allows complex queries across gates
3. **Interoperability**: Standard formats (RDF, JSON) for integration
4. **Traceability**: Complete audit trail of deliverables
5. **Scalability**: Pattern applies to all 13 stage gates

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**:
   - Test with real triple store
   - Create visualization dashboard
   - Add user authentication

2. **Short-term**:
   - Implement remaining stage gates (1-12)
   - Add dependency management
   - Create automated notifications

3. **Long-term**:
   - Machine learning for timeline prediction
   - Risk assessment integration
   - Cross-project analytics

## Conclusion

This Stage Gate 0 example demonstrates a complete, working implementation of a stage gate process from data extraction through workflow simulation. The modular design and standard formats make it easy to scale to the full set of stage gates while maintaining consistency and interoperability.
