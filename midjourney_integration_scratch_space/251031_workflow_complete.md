# Successful TTL Generation Workflow
**Date:** October 31, 2025, 16:30 PST  
**Objective:** Generate knowledge graph from new Excel input with enhanced ontology  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - All tests passed

## Workflow Summary

### Step 1: Excel Extraction ✅
- Extracted 5 CSV files from Excel
- Main data file: 697KB SGD.csv with 3,979 rows

### Step 2: TTL Generation ✅ 
- Fixed file selection issue (was picking SME.csv, now correctly picks SGD.csv)
- Generated: 37 stages, 6,857 triples
- Output: 1.1MB instances file

### Step 3: File Combination ✅
- Combined base ontology + instances + GIST alignment
- Created: 7,605 lines / 1.1MB complete file
- Total: 12,570 triples

### Step 4: Validation ✅
All tests passed:
- Syntax validation: VALID (rapper verified)
- New properties verified:
  - Category: 1,173 occurrences 
  - Plan dates: Included
  - Actual dates: Included
  - References: 7 document references
- GIST alignment: 51 references confirmed
- PROV-O and QUDT integration verified

## Files Created/Modified

### Scripts Updated
- `generate_cmc_ttl.py`: Fixed file selection pattern, added new property mappings

### Ontology Enhanced  
- `cmc_stagegate_base.ttl`: Added 4 new properties (hasCategory, plannedDate, actualDate, reference)

### Output Generated
- `output/current/cmc_stagegate_instances.ttl`: 1.1MB, 12,309 triples
- `output/current/cmc_stagegate_all.ttl`: 1.1MB, 12,570 triples

## Data Transformation Achieved
- Input: 3,979 Excel rows with 13 columns
- Output: 12,570 semantic triples
- Created: 37 stages, ~2,000+ deliverables
- Categories: 25 unique (API Development, DP Analytics, etc.)
- Enhanced with temporal tracking and documentation references

## Implemented vs Proposed
**Implemented:**
- Complete ETL pipeline with new data structure
- All 4 new properties successfully integrated
- Full validation and testing completed

**Ready for:**
- Loading into Protege for visualization
- SPARQL querying
- GraphDB deployment
- Stakeholder presentation

## Next Steps
Knowledge graph ready for production use with enhanced ontology!
