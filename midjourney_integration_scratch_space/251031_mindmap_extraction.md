# MindMap Extraction Session
**Date**: October 31, 2025  
**Time**: 14:00  
**Objective**: Extract hierarchical stage-gate structure from MindMap HTML file

## Summary
User requested integration of MindMap visualization (LM SGates Mmap Updates Q3 2023) with the CMC Stage-Gate ontology to create modality-specific nodes like "Protein Stage Gate".

## Files Changed
1. Created `/docs/MINDMAP_INTEGRATION_PROPOSAL.md` - Comprehensive proposal for integration
2. Created `/scripts/etl/extract_mindmap_data.py` - Python script to extract MindMap data
3. Generated `/output/current/mindmap_structure.ttl` - Extracted structure (36,961 nodes!)

## Key Findings

### MindMap Structure
- Successfully decoded base64 .mmap file from HTML
- Found it's a ZIP archive containing:
  - Document.xml (main MindMap structure)
  - Preview.png
  - XSD schema files
- XML uses MindManager namespace: `http://schemas.mindjet.com/MindManager/Application/2003`

### Extraction Results
- **Total Nodes Found**: 36,961 nodes in hierarchical structure
- **Root Node**: Single OneTopic with massive child list (1,374 direct children)
- **Text Content Issue**: Node text not properly extracted - showing as "Node_1", "Node_2" etc.

### Technical Issues
1. Text extraction pattern needs adjustment for MindManager XML format
2. Need to handle different text storage patterns:
   - Text might be in attributes
   - Could be in PlainText elements
   - Might use different namespace

## Next Steps
1. Debug text extraction from MindManager XML
2. Identify Protein vs CGT nodes based on text content
3. Map to existing stage gates in ontology
4. Create proper modality-specific instances

## Implementation vs Proposed
- **Proposed**: Clean extraction with text labels and modality detection
- **Implemented**: Structure extracted successfully, but text content missing

## Verification Steps
```bash
# Check extraction
python scripts/etl/extract_mindmap_data.py "data/LM SGates*" output/current/mindmap_structure.ttl

# Verify output
head -100 output/current/mindmap_structure.ttl
grep -i "protein\|cgt\|stage" output/current/mindmap_structure.ttl
```

## Status
Partial success - hierarchical structure extracted but text content needs work. The massive scale (36K+ nodes) suggests this is a comprehensive stage-gate visualization worth integrating.
