# CMC Stage-Gate Ontology Analysis Session
**Date:** October 31, 2025, 15:35 PST  
**Objective:** Analyze and document the current ontology structure, dependencies, and concepts  
**Status:** Completed

## Commands Executed
```bash
python3 scripts/validation/verify_ttl_files.py --verbose
```

## Findings Summary

### Ontology Architecture
- **Hybrid model**: 75% custom CMC concepts, 25% external standards
- **Triple count**: 15,166 total (389 core + 14,777 generated)
- **Core classes**: 11 domain-specific classes
- **Properties**: 29 (15 object, 14 data properties)

### External Dependencies
1. **GIST Ontology**: Upper ontology for semantic patterns (47 alignments)
2. **PROV-O**: W3C standard for provenance tracking  
3. **QUDT**: Quantities and units for measurements
4. **Additional**: SKOS, GS1, FHIR, P-Plan

### Key Concepts Defined
- **ex:Stage**: Development phase (mapped to gist:PlannedEvent)
- **ex:StageGate**: Review/decision point (mapped to gist:Event)
- **ex:QualityAttribute**: Deliverables/CQAs (mapped to gist:Aspect)
- **ex:AnalyticalResult**: Test results (mapped to gist:Magnitude)

### Recent Enhancements
Added 4 new properties to support expanded data:
- ex:hasCategory (1,172 categorized items, 25 unique categories)
- ex:plannedDate (planned completion dates)
- ex:actualDate (actual completion dates)  
- ex:reference (document references)

## Endpoints Affected
None - this was analysis only

## Verification Steps
1. ✅ Analyzed all 5 TTL files (base, align, examples, instances, combined)
2. ✅ Verified 15,166 total triples
3. ✅ Confirmed GIST alignments working correctly
4. ✅ Documented in docs/ONTOLOGY_ANALYSIS.md

## Implemented vs Proposed
**Implemented:**
- Complete ontology analysis and documentation
- Created comprehensive ONTOLOGY_ANALYSIS.md
- Identified strengths, gaps, and recommendations

**Proposed Future Work:**
- Add stage sequencing properties (hasNextStage/hasPreviousStage)
- Enhance role modeling with SKOS concepts
- Add risk assessment properties
- Migrate to GIST v13 when stable
- Create SHACL shapes for validation

## Next Steps
Ready to generate TTL files with the enhanced ontology including all new properties.
