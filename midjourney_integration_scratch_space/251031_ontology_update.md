# Ontology Update for New Data Columns
**Date:** October 31, 2025, 15:23 PST  
**Objective:** Update CMC Stage-Gate ontology to support new data columns in Excel input  

## Summary of Findings

### Data Changes Detected
1. **Category column (col 5)** - Previously empty, now contains 1,172 rows with 25 unique category values:
   - API Development, API Analytics Development
   - DP Development, DP Analytics Development  
   - Biopharmaceutics, CMC Regulatory Dossier Development
   - Continuous Manufacturing, etc.

2. **Three new columns added (cols 11-13)**:
   - Plan date (replaces VPAD-specific?)
   - Actual date (new)
   - Comments/Document reference (new)

### Files Changed
1. **cmc_stagegate_base.ttl**:
   - Added ex:hasCategory property for category classification
   - Added ex:plannedDate property for planned dates
   - Added ex:actualDate property for actual dates
   - Added ex:reference property for document references

2. **scripts/etl/generate_cmc_ttl.py**:
   - Updated OFFICIAL_COLS mapping to include new columns
   - Modified emit_deliverable_blocks to extract and output all new properties
   - Now extracts: category, plan_date, actual_date, comments

### Implementation Status
✅ Completed - Ontology and scripts updated to handle all new data
⏳ Next step - User to run TTL generation pipeline

### Verification Steps
1. Run: `python3 scripts/etl/generate_cmc_ttl.py`
2. Run: `python3 scripts/etl/combine_ttls.py`
3. Run: `python3 scripts/validation/verify_ttl_files.py`
4. Verify new properties appear in generated TTL

### Notes
- Category data is significant addition (35% of rows have categories)
- All changes are backward compatible
- No column positions changed for existing data
