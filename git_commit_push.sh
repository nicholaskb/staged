COMMIT_MSG="refactor: reorganize TTL files and clean up root directory

Major repository restructuring for better organization:

TTL File Reorganization:
- Created data/required_ttl_files/ directory
- Moved 6 core ontology files from root to new directory
- Moved 3 example files from data/ to new directory
- All 9 TTL files now centralized in one location

Script Updates:
- Updated combine_ttls.py with new file paths
- Updated validate_gist_alignment.py with new paths
- Updated export_to_graphdb.py with new paths  
- Updated verify_critical_files.sh to check new locations

Root Directory Cleanup:
- Removed one-time reorganization scripts (3 files)
- Removed temporary documentation (5 files)
- Root now contains only essential scripts (5 files)
- 62% reduction in root directory clutter

Benefits:
- Cleaner repository structure
- All required TTL files in one place
- Easier to locate and manage files
- Pipeline continues to work with new structure"
