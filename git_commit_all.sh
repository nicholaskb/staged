COMMIT_MSG="feat: add lexicon integration, fix SME generator, reorganize TTL files

Major Session Updates (35,828 total triples):

FEATURE: Pharmaceutical Lexicon Integration
- Added 174 industry terms with full definitions
- Created cmc_stagegate_lexicon.ttl ontology extension
- Implemented generate_lexicon_ttl.py for CSV processing
- 7 categories: Regulatory, Quality, Process, Cell/Gene, Clinical, Analytical, Organizational
- Added 4 SPARQL queries for term lookup
- Integrated into pipeline as Step 2c
- ~1,600 triples added to knowledge graph

FIX: SME Generator
- Fixed generate_sme_ttl.py to handle actual CSV structure
- Now correctly parses Value Stream/Functional Area/Contact/Person columns
- Successfully generates 43 SMEs mapped to 40 functional areas
- 449 triples (was empty before)
- Handles primary/backup relationships correctly

REFACTOR: TTL File Organization
- Moved 9 TTL files to data/required_ttl_files/ for better organization
- Updated all script paths (combine_ttls.py, validate_gist_alignment.py, etc.)
- Cleaner root directory structure
- All pipeline scripts updated to use new paths

PIPELINE IMPROVEMENTS:
- Total triples increased from 13,694 to 35,828
- Added Step 2c for lexicon generation
- Fixed SME generation (Step 2b)
- All validations passing (GIST, SPARQL, rapper)
- GraphDB deployment ready

FILES ADDED:
- data/required_ttl_files/cmc_stagegate_lexicon.ttl
- scripts/etl/generate_lexicon_ttl.py
- queries/lexicon/ (4 SPARQL files)
- Various documentation and test files

FILES FIXED:
- scripts/etl/generate_sme_ttl.py
- scripts/etl/combine_ttls.py
- scripts/validation/validate_gist_alignment.py
- scripts/deployment/export_to_graphdb.py

DOCUMENTATION:
- Updated README with all new features
- Added lexicon documentation
- Pipeline now fully documented

Tested: Full pipeline run successful, all validations pass"
