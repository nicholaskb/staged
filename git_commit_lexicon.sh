COMMIT_MSG="feat: add pharmaceutical lexicon integration (174 terms)

Major feature addition: Comprehensive pharmaceutical/biotechnology terminology database

New Ontology Extension:
- Created cmc_stagegate_lexicon.ttl with DefinedTerm class
- 7 term categories (Regulatory, Quality, Process, Cell/Gene, Clinical, Analytical, Organizational)
- Properties for abbreviations, definitions, criticality, and stage linkages
- SKOS integration for semantic web compatibility

New Functionality:
- generate_lexicon_ttl.py processes Lexicon CSV to RDF
- Auto-categorizes 174 pharmaceutical terms
- Flags critical terms (CQA, CPP, PPQ, etc.)
- Links terms to relevant stages
- GUPRI-compliant IDs for persistence

Pipeline Integration:
- Added Step 2c to run_pipeline.sh for lexicon generation
- Updated combine_ttls.py to include lexicon files
- Execution order: Main ‚Üí SME ‚Üí Lexicon ‚Üí Combine
- Increases total triples from 13,694+ to 15,000+

SPARQL Queries:
- Lookup any abbreviation definition
- Find critical and regulatory terms
- Group terms by category
- Find stage-specific terminology

Documentation:
- Updated README with lexicon feature description
- Created comprehensive analysis and integration guides
- Added test and verification scripts

Business Value:
- Instant definition lookup for any abbreviation
- Regulatory compliance term tracking
- Enhanced onboarding with complete glossary
- Stage-specific term usage visibility
- Cross-referencing with deliverables and SMEs

Files Added:
- data/required_ttl_files/cmc_stagegate_lexicon.ttl
- scripts/etl/generate_lexicon_ttl.py
- queries/lexicon/ (4 SPARQL queries)
- docs/LEXICON_*.md (documentation)
- test_lexicon.sh, verify_lexicon_pipeline.sh

Tested: Lexicon generator working, pipeline integration verified"
